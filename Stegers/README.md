The Stegers directory contains MATLAB scripts focused on image processing techniques, particularly involving Gaussian filtering and Hessian matrix computations.â€‹

ðŸ“„ File Descriptions
GaussianFilter.m: Applies a Gaussian filter to an image, which is useful for smoothing and noise reduction.â€‹

Stegers.m: Implements algorithms related to the Stegers method, potentially for feature detection or image analysis.â€‹

getCenterLinePixels.m: Extracts the central line pixels from a given image, aiding in the analysis of linear structures.â€‹

getEigFromHess.m: Calculates the eigenvalues from the Hessian matrix of an image, which can be used for edge or corner detection.â€‹

getHessianMatrix.m: Computes the Hessian matrix of an image, capturing second-order derivatives to identify regions of interest.â€‹

getSigma.m: Determines the appropriate sigma value for Gaussian filtering, which controls the degree of smoothing.â€‹

These scripts collectively provide tools for advanced image analysis tasks in MATLAB, such as feature extraction and image enhancement.
